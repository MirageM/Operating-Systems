Zombie Process is a child process that has finished its execution but still sticks around in the process table, waiting to be reaped by the parent process. Usually, the parent process checks on their child’s process by calling wait or waitpid, which the kernel deletes the zombie process but if the parent fails to call wait, the process entry table sticks around and that’s what makes it a zombie. A single zombie process wouldn’t pose a threat but a built-up of zombie processes would slow down the operating system.
